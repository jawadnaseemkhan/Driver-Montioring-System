Integrating Facial Expression Analysis and Road Maneuvers Monitoring for Enhanced Driving Performance
Overview

This project focuses on developing a system that integrates facial expression analysis with road maneuver monitoring to improve driving performance. By analyzing the driver's emotions and correlating them with vehicle movements and road conditions, the system aims to enhance road safety and reduce driver stress.
Objectives

    Facial Expression Analysis: Detect and analyze the driver’s emotions in real-time using computer vision techniques.
    Road Maneuver Monitoring: Track vehicle maneuvers such as lane changes, turns, and speed variations.
    Performance Enhancement: Correlate facial data with driving maneuvers to provide actionable feedback, improving overall driving performance.

Planned Features

    Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection using libraries such as OpenCV and deep learning models.
    Road Maneuver Monitoring leveraging road data from driving simulators or real-world sensors.
    Data Integration: Combining facial expression data with driving maneuvers for comprehensive analysis.
    Real-Time Feedback: Developing an interface to provide instant feedback or warnings to the driver.

Technologies

    Python for data processing and algorithm development.
    OpenCV for facial expression detection.
    scikit-learn or TensorFlow for machine learning models.
    Driving Simulators (e.g., CARLA) or real-world data for monitoring road behavior.
